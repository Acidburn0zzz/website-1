            <h2>Contribute to Arch Linux Women</h2>
	        <p>Arch Linux Women is community driven, and without contributions, the project will die. Even small 
                contributions add up to something great, so please get involved where you can. There are a ton of ways 
                that both new and old members can contribute, and you don't have to be a programmer or have large amounts
                of free time to help.</p>
                <p>A few of the ways you can contribute include:</p>
            <h3>Tell others about the project</h3>
                <p>If you know any women who use Linux, or even just might be interested in learning, tell them about our
                project. Mention us in one of your social media updates or make a blog post about our organization. Print out 
                some of our flyers and post them up around your College CS lab. The first step to getting more people involved 
                with Arch Linux Women, is telling them about Arch Linux Women.</p>
            <h3>Chat in our IRC channels</h3>                
                <p>Arch Women has two IRC channels on irc.freenode.net - #archlinux-women and #archlinux-women-dev. 
                Before joining in please, please read the channel rules and community standards. Our main chat is used 
                for networking, learning and discussion. Our developement chat is used for Arch Women project developement,
                such as the IRC bot, the website, and server tools. You can jump in there to see our git commits and learn
                how things are done "behind the scenes".</p>
