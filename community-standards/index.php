        <p>Arch Women contains a diverse group of people who have come together to 
        lower the barriers for women to contribute to Arch Linux and FOSS as well as
        make friends and have fun. Our community standards are a set of guidelines for 
        members to follow when they interact with each other.</p>
        <p>Our online community includes the main archwomen.org website, social media groups, 
        and our IRC channels. We expect community members to be helpful and
        respectful. Treat others how you would like to be treated and take responsibility
        for your words and actions. Spamming, trolling, harassment, bullying, 
        discrimination and threatening behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
