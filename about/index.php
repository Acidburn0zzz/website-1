      <h1 role="heading">About Arch Women</h1>
      <p>The goal of Arch Women is to foster female involvement in Arch Linux 
      and Free Open Source Software. The community is open to female Linux 
      enthusiasts and users, and to the people who support them. If you would like 
      to join us, please have a look at our community standards to get a feel 
      for how our community is run.</p>
      <p>Arch Women has a monthly IRC meeting on the first Sunday of every month. 
      They generally run for about 2 hours and start at 16:00 UTC.</p>
      <p>The Arch Women <a href="/blog">Blog</a> is a place to discuss and share 
      information in a contained and moderated way. <a href="/blog/submit">Submissions</a> 
      are welcome from anyone who would like to share something.</p>
      <p>The #archlinux-women channel was created to provide a "safe space" for 
      people to chat without the need to hide their gender or sexual identity. 
      We also have other ways you can <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
      <h2 role="heading">History</h2>
      <p>Arch Women was founded in February 2012 by Dolores Portalatin - 
      "meskarune". It sprang from an IRC conversation in #archlinux-offtopic about 
      how few women openly contribute to the Arch Linux community. From there an 
      IRC channel (#archlinux-women) was created for planning, a few long time Arch 
      Linux users joined in, and two days later the main website was up and running. 
      Since that time, Arch Women has changed servers twice and tripled in membership.</p>
